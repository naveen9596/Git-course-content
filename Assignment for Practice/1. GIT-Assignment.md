For a Git and GitHub assignment with hands-on activities, here’s a suggested outline. It covers fundamental and advanced skills in Git, as well as practical collaboration tasks with GitHub.

### **Assignment: Mastering Git and GitHub**

**Objective:**  
To strengthen practical knowledge in version control using Git and GitHub, covering basic to advanced commands, branching, merging, and collaborative workflows.

**Requirements:**  
- Git installed on your local machine
- GitHub account

---

### **Part 1: Git Basics**

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Initialize a new Git repository on your local machine.
   - Create a `README.md` file and write a brief description of the project.
   - Stage and commit your changes with an appropriate commit message.

2. **Tracking Changes**
   - Create a new file called `index.html`.
   - Add basic HTML structure and some content.
   - Stage and commit the changes.
   - Make a few changes to the file, then use `git diff` to view changes before committing.
   - Commit these changes.

3. **Exploring the Commit History**
   - Run `git log` to view the commit history.
   - Use `git log --oneline` for a compact view.
   - Pick a specific commit and use `git show <commit-hash>` to display the changes introduced in that commit.

### **Part 2: Branching and Merging**

1. **Creating and Switching Branches**
   - Create a new branch named `feature/homepage`.
   - Switch to this branch and make changes to `index.html` to create a homepage layout.
   - Commit the changes.

2. **Merging Branches**
   - Switch back to the `main` branch.
   - Merge the `feature/homepage` branch into the `main` branch.
   - Resolve any merge conflicts if they occur and commit the final merged changes.

3. **Deleting Branches**
   - Once merged, delete the `feature/homepage` branch to keep the repository clean.

### **Part 3: Collaborative Work with GitHub**

1. **Creating a Remote Repository**
   - Create a new repository on GitHub (do not initialize it with a README).
   - Link your local Git repository to this GitHub repository using `git remote add origin <repository-URL>`.
   - Push your local `main` branch to GitHub.

2. **Collaborating with Pull Requests**
   - Create a new branch called `feature/about-page`.
   - Add a new `about.html` file with some content, commit the changes, and push this branch to GitHub.
   - Go to GitHub and open a pull request from `feature/about-page` to `main`.
   - Merge the pull request on GitHub.

3. **Using Issues and Linking Pull Requests**
   - Create an issue on GitHub describing an enhancement to add a contact page.
   - Link the issue to a new pull request by:
     - Creating a `feature/contact-page` branch locally.
     - Adding a `contact.html` file.
     - Committing and pushing this branch to GitHub.
   - In the pull request description, reference the issue (e.g., “Closes #<issue-number>”).
   - Merge the pull request, closing the issue automatically.

### **Part 4: Advanced Git Commands**

1. **Stashing Changes**
   - Make changes to `index.html` without committing.
   - Use `git stash` to save the changes temporarily.
   - After stashing, modify and commit a different file.
   - Use `git stash apply` to bring back the stashed changes and commit them.

2. **Rebasing**
   - Create a branch called `feature/footer`.
   - Make some changes related to the footer section and commit.
   - Use `git rebase main` while on the `feature/footer` branch, then push changes to GitHub.

3. **Reverting and Resetting**
   - Make and commit a few dummy changes.
   - Use `git revert` to undo a specific commit while keeping the history.
   - Use `git reset` (soft or hard) to undo the last commit and discuss the differences.

### **Submission Instructions**

1. Share the link to your GitHub repository with all branches and pull requests.
2. Include screenshots or terminal outputs for major commands, especially for:
   - Initial commits and branch creation.
   - Merge conflicts, if any.
   - Pull requests and issue linking.
3. Write a brief reflection on what you found challenging or interesting in the assignment.
