   - **Merging Branches**: Combining work from different branches.
   - **Resolving Merge Conflicts**: Introduction to handling conflicts during merges.

   **Hands-On Activity**:
   - Create a new branch and make changes in it.
   - Switch back to the main branch and make conflicting changes.
   - Merge the branch into the main branch and resolve any conflicts.

#### **5. Introduction to GitHub**
   - **What is GitHub?**: Overview of GitHub as a platform for Git-based collaboration.
   - **Creating a GitHub Account**: Guide for participants to set up GitHub accounts if they don’t already have one.
   - **Repositories on GitHub**: Creating, forking, and deleting repositories.
   - **GitHub Workflow**: Pushing and pulling changes between local and remote repositories.
   
   **Hands-On Activity**:
   - Create a new repository on GitHub.
   - Link the local Git repository to the GitHub repository using `git remote add`.
   - Push local commits to GitHub with `git push`.

---

#### **6. Collaborating on GitHub**
   - **Forking and Cloning**: Forking another user’s repository and cloning to work on it.
   - **Pull Requests**: Creating pull requests to contribute to a project.
   - **Code Review**: Reviewing code in pull requests and merging them.

   **Hands-On Activity**:
   - Participants fork a shared repository.
   - Make changes in their forked repository and create a pull request.
   - Conduct a basic code review and merge pull requests.

---

#### **7. Working with GitHub Issues and Projects**
   - **Using Issues for Tracking**: Creating and managing GitHub Issues.
   - **Organizing Work with Projects**: Creating a project board and using it to manage tasks.
   
   **Hands-On Activity**:
   - Create a GitHub Issue describing a bug or feature.
   - Organize Issues into a Project board and assign them to collaborators.

---

#### **8. Advanced Git Techniques (Optional)**
   - **Stashing Changes**: Temporarily storing work in progress with `git stash`.
   - **Rebasing**: Keeping commit history linear with `git rebase`.
   - **Interactive Rebase**: Editing commit history for better clarity.

   **Hands-On Activity**:
   - Use `git stash` to save changes and retrieve them later.
   - Practice rebasing a branch onto the main branch.
   - Use interactive rebase to combine or re-order commits.

---

### **Q&A and Troubleshooting**
   - Open session for participants to ask questions and discuss any issues they encountered.
